# // todo

An almost entirely useless todo app.

## Built specifically for you

There are many ways to assign projects for potential developer candidates.  A lot of them are overly time-consuming, stressful, don't do a good job of representing your ability, or even downright predatory.  I’ve decided to try a different route.  This is a fairly simple application bootstrapped with `create-react-app` and populated with the sparsest of functionality for creating and “completing” written tasks.  I’ve taken care of all of the boiler plate and have created a working React + Redux skeleton.

Well… sort of.

## “So, what do I do?”

First off, you’ll notice that there is no code.  When you clone this repository, you will be greeted by a nearly empty directory.  This is the beginning of the puzzle.

*Disclaimer: I ask that you spend no more than 5 hours on this project.  Unless you’re super into it, then by all means, but it’s a pretty dumb application.*

The end goal is for you to create a new branch and add at least one feature.  This can be some incomplete functionality or something entirely new that you think would improve or expand the utility of the application.  There will be plenty to choose from.  There are also things documented in the issue tracker if you have no ideas.

At the risk of giving away too much, I feel that I should disclose this much:  the application has worked before.

Try this: git branch -r
